Test-Legal version 0.01
=======================

 Test::Legal checks for LICENSE file, for copyright annotations
in .pl and .pm files of lib/ and script/ directories, and some
legal-related fields of META.yml (or META.json). 

 Problems are fixable manually in the usual way, or use 
the included copyright-injection.pl and license-injection.pl to
fix them using scripts. (See the EXAMPLES dir, or type --help .)
